/**
The battery boxes currently have a ~1-1 conversion ration of Joules to FE. 


AC Motor Conversion Efficiancy : 90%
Ex: 10 J -> 9 FE



DC Motor Conversion Efficiancy: 85%
Ex: 20 FE -> 17 J



While less efficiant than the battery boxes, the motors remove the issues with currents and
FE machines blowing up.
